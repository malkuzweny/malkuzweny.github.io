Hello! My name is Manar Alkuzweny, and I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Biological Sciences at the University of Notre Dame where I will be joining the [Perkins lab](http://perkinslab.weebly.com/). I earned my B.S. in Public Health with a Concentration in Epidemiology and a minor in General Biology at the University of California, San Diego.

My primary research interest lies in the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases endemic to low- and middle-income countries. I am especially interested in investigating factors that affect the distribution of these diseases, and determining the efficacy of public health interventions designed to reduce their burden.
